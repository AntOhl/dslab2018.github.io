# Week 4: Graded Homework 1

Go over to <https://git-dslab.epfl.ch/> and create an account with your EPFL e-mail if you have not yet done so.
This instance of gitlab resides within EPFL premises, so to access it from outside the campus network,
you'll need a VPN (<https://epnet.epfl.ch/cms/site/network/lang/en/Remote-Internet-Access>).
Please note that the accounts are not sync'd with EPFL accounts, so you should use another password.

If not done yet, create a group on gitlab and invite your fellow students:
Top indigo nav bar > Left > Groups then hit the green button 'New Group'.
From your group page, click on the 'Members' menu and invite others.

Go to <https://git-dslab.epfl.ch/dslab2018/homework1> and click on 'Fork'.
Be sure to select your group.

Open the notebook to find all the questions for this assignment.
There are 4 sections totalling to 60 points.
You can also find a version on gitlab: <https://git-dslab.epfl.ch/dslab2018/homework1/blob/master/Assignment_DataScience_Lab_week4.ipynb>.

Commit and push regularly your changes to gitlab.
The content of the master branch of your repository at the time of the deadline will be used for
grading your work.
In other words, if you push changes past the deadline, these will NOT be
taken into account.
